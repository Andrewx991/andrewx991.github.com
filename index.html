          <h2>2016 Books in Review</h2>
          1.11.2017
          <p>
            2016 was the first year in too long a time that I was really able to get back into reading for enjoyment.
            There are serveral books I particularly enjoyed and would like to call out here. You can read my reviews below.
            <ul>
              <li>Busy: How to Thrive in a World of Too Much - Tony Crabbe
              <li>The Effective Executive - Peter Drucker
              <li>Site Reliability Engineering - Google SRE Team
              <li>Clean Code - Robert Martin
              <li>The Good Soldiers - David Finkel
            </ul>
          </p>

              <p>
                I wanted to start with this one because for me 2016 was a busy year.
                I got married, left school, took up new hobbies and took on additional responsibilites at work.
                This book gives practical advice that helped me realize I was becoming more busy than productive and course correct.
                I would recommend to anyone who feels like they are spinning their wheels... Its like traction control, but for life?

                Short, well written, and contains extremely valuable lessons, you can't ask much more from a book. 
                The Effective Executive, despite its title, is useful for any individual that wants to be an effective decision maker.
                Drucker uses historical examples and elegantly simple sentences to explain that effectiveness can be learned and it is important to learn it.
                I would recommend to pretty much anyone unless they are content with just taking orders.

                  There's a point when having people manually deploy and operate software doesn't scale, this book lays down the path beyond that using Google as an example.
                  It focuses on one key thing that I often see software companies neglect: reliability.
                  It doesn't matter how fast you can churn out new stuff if the old stuff keeps breaking.
                  I'll be honest, I only read the first 18 chapters and cherry picked from the rest, but it was well worth it.
                  I would recommend to every developer as I am a firm believer (thanks in part to this book) that its not good system design if you don't account for the long term operation.

                  A common recommendation amongst developers and I can see why.
                  If you follow the habits in this book I can't guarentee you will write good code, but if you write good code, you probably follow the habits described in this book.
                  Seriously, if you simply read this and try to follow its rules you aren't going to write good code, or more importantly, good software.
                  Only by understanding why good systems often satisfy these rules will you learn to write it yourself.
                  I found the first 12 chapters to be the most valuable, and similar to the SRE book, cherry picked the rest.

                  I'll finish with a non-career oriented book, The Good Soldiers.
                  It was recommended to me by a very wise former colleague.
                  If you really want to know what modern war is like, give this a read.
                  Brutually realisitc and honest. I would recommend to any U.S. citizen that cares about our military operations.
                  I am looking forward to reading its follow up, Thank You For Your Service, in 2017.

          <h2>Performance Tuning</h2>
          1.5.2017
          <p>
            I read a cool article about 
              <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-things-i-learned-making-the-fastest-site-in-the-world-18a0e1cdf4a7">building a fast site</a>
            and wanted to try some techniques out.
            So I took a few minutes to performance test and optimized a few things.
            See
                <a href="https://github.com/Andrewx991/andrewx991.github.com/commit/bc9e75e594d481629066dbd8c1ba9d2524dbd03d">the commit</a>
            for details.

            The out come was reducing my time to first paint by a few hundred milliseconds.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For you:
            <br/>
            The time to load all DOM content was <span id="timeToDomLoaded">(Loading...)</span>.
            <br/>
            The time to first paint was <span id="timeToFirstPaint">(Loading...)</span>.
            <br/>
            The time to fire the load event was <span id="timeToLoad">(Loading...)</span>.
